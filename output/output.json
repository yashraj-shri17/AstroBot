Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc हिन्दी Missions SARAL-AltiKa Introduction Objectives SpaceCraft Payloads Data Products Documents ",

The main objective of this mission is to understand the life cycle of convective systems that influence the tropical weather and climate and their role in associated energy and moisture budget of the atmosphere in tropical regions. Megha-Tropiques provides scientific data on the contribution of the water cycle to the tropical atmosphere, with information on condensed water in clouds, water vapour in the atmosphere, precipitation, and evaporation. With its circular orbit inclined 20 deg to the equator, the Megha-Tropiques is a unique satellite for climate research that should also aid scientists seeking to refine prediction models.

Prerequisites: For running this application, you will need following things: i .   Python (Version 3+) ii. Python Library: 'requests' iii. MOSDAC Account credentials (Refer section 5 for ' Authentication ' ) iv. 'datasetId' (Refer section 5 for ' How to find your DatasetId (datasetId) ?' ) Optional Requirement: i. Python Library: 'tqdm' Steps to Install Python Libraries: Requests: i. Check if you have the 'requests' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show requests If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. ii. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install requests This will successfully install the 'requests' module in your system. You can follow the first step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. Tqdm (Optional): iii. Check if you have the 'tqdm' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show tqdm If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. iv. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install tqdm This will successfully install the 'requests'module in your system. You can follow the previous step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. [ Hint : Although not a requirement, installing the Python library - 'tqdm', will provide an enhanced download experience by providing a well-structured 'Progress Bar' while downloading data, providing a clean and visually appealing download process.] 2. How to Download, Install & Run: i. Download 'mdapi' from: https://mosdac.gov.in/software/mdapi.zip ii. Unzip the folder in your desired directory. One will find the following files: a. mdapi.py b. config.json Following is the structure of config.json: { \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" }, \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"\", \"startTime\": \"\", \"endTime\": \"\", \"count\": \"\", \"boundingBox\": \"\", \"gId\": \"\" }, \"download_settings\": { \"download_path\": \"\", \"organize_by_date\":false, \"skip_user_prompt\":false, \"generate_error_log\":false, \"error_log_path\": \"\" } } [ Important Tip : Make sure you don't change the name of your Configuration File, i.e. - 'config.json'. Doing so will prevent successful execution of your 'mdapi.py' code, as the name of the Configuration file is already pre-configured inside it.] iii. Edit config.json correctly as per your data requirement, along with your user credentials. ( Refer section: ' Parameter Reference of config.json ' ) iv. In your terminal, run: python mdapi.py v. After fetching the search results, you will see the following message: (If skip_user_prompt is set false ) Do you want to start downloading? (Y/N): vi. Type Y (or Yes) and hit Enter to start the download process. vii. After the Download is complete, you will see a logout message, containing: Download Complete! Logout Successful. Goodbye (your_username) ! [ Background Download : For background downloading set 'skip_user_input' as - true in your 'config.json' file. This will start data download without user interaction.] [ Daily Download Limit : We allow users to download a maximum of 5000 data files per day, per user. If your download exceeds that limit, you will see the message: 'You have reached your Daily Download Quota (5000 per day)' and will be automatically logged out. You will have to wait until the next day if you want to download more data.] 3. Data Download Workflow: Data download workflow includes the following steps to download data through MOSDAC: i. Data Search : Based on the input provided by the user in 'search_parameter' of 'client.json', our application will first fetch the total available files count and their total size. For this, one should know the required 'datasetId'. (Refer section 4 for details) ii. Authentication process : Once the search results are retrieved, if the user provides the input to proceed for download, user authentication takes place. (Refer section 5 for details) iii. Data download : After successful authentication, the data download begins as per user defined configuration. iv . Logout : After completion of the entire process, the user is logged out automatically. 4. Searching data: You don't need to log in to search; an account is only required to download data . If your goal is just to search or preview available datasets using filters like datasetId , startTime , or boundingBox , etc., you can leave the 'user_credentials' blank. No authentication is needed in that case. However, DatasetId is required for search. Following section will guide you how to find your DatasetId: How to Find Your Dataset ID ( datasetId )? In the config.json file, under the search_parameters section, there is a required field called datasetId . This field specifies which dataset you want to download from , and it is mandatory for the application to fetch any data. Where to Find Available Dataset IDs You can explore the available dataset IDs here: Browse datasets : https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php On this page, you can: Browse or filter datasets based on: o Satellite o Sensor o Search Find your desired Product Name (Eg: 3SIMG_L1B_STD, E06OCM_L2C_AD ) , which corresponds to the datasetId you should enter in your config file. Example Workflow i. Visit the dataset browser: https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php ii. Use filters to narrow down your options by satellite, sensor, etc. iii. Identify the product you're interested in. iv. Copy the Product Name exactly as shown - this is your datasetId . Example: If the product name is 3SIMG_L1B_STD , then your config should include: \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1B_STD\" Tip: Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces in the datasetId . It must match the platform's listing exactly . 5. Authentication and Account Requirements To download any data using this application, you must first authenticate yourself using valid credentials. Authentication Process The application uses your MOSDAC Account credentials (username and password) to authenticate your session before downloading begins. These credentials must be provided in the config.json file under the user_credentials section: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Important: Without valid credentials, you will not be able to download any data. Don't Have an Account? If you donâ€™t already have an account, you must create one first: Create your account here : https://mosdac.gov.in/signup/ Once your registration is complete and your account is approved , you will be eligible to use the application for downloading datasets. Forgot Your Password? You can reset your password here: Reset your password : https://mosdac.gov.in/auth/realms/Mosdac/login-actions/reset-credentials Failed Login Attempts If you enter incorrect credentials three times consecutively , your account will be temporarily locked for 1 hour .

The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget and Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and  Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR  provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels.  A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation. 7 Dataset Contact Neerja Sharma and Kaushik Gopalan, GRD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380015, kaushikg@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update Frequency January 2017 to May 2018 have been processed.

This satellite is developed out of a small I-1000 bus made of carbon fibre re-enforced plastic light weight structure, a uni power bus employing an 18AH Ni-Cd battery and a single GaAs/Ge solar panel generating 640 watts of power. Metsat uses a 3-axis stabilized momentum biased attitude control system with suitable linearly controlled magnetic torquers for solar radiation pressure compensation. A unified propulsion system of bi-propellant apogee motor of 440 Newtons and the reaction control engines of 22 Newtons has been selected for efficient and versatile mission management. Metsat carries on-board a Very High ResolutionRadiometer (VHRR) and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) for weather data transmission. VHRR provides earth imageries in visible band with a resolution of2 km, in thermal infrared and water vapor bands with 8 km. DRT collects weather data from un-attended data collection platforms located throughout India and transmits the same to centrally located Meteorological Data Utilisation Centre. The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a lift–off mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries. हिन्दी Missions KALPANA-1 Introduction Objectives SpaceCraft Payloads Data Products ",

It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1°X 0.1° on a latitude/longitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) algorithm (Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022) with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared (IR) technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared (MVK) combined (Mega et al. 2019). A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. (2022).

The radar reflectivity has been corrected for clutter using a combination of a spatial continuity filter and a fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm. The velocity folded regions are dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing algorithm. The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity are then gridded into 1 km x 1 km x 250 m 3D volumetric grid which can be used by scientists for further meteorological applications.

Also, hydrological modelling studies face the challenge of decreasing availability of in-situ monitoring data. However, application of satellite radar altimetry over the inland water bodies becomes vital tool to estimate water levels through waveform retracking on satellite altimetry?s sensor data. SARAL-Altika was launched on 25 February 2013. It is a joint-mission of CNES France and ISRO to provide continuous monitoring of ocean and continental water surface. It was launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790km with 35 days of orbit repetition and follows same ground track as ENVISAT satellite. It has 98.55 deg of inclination with 75 km of equatorial cross track separation. It has Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter. Water level product for inland water bodies (presently for Brahmaputra river and Ukai Reservoir) has been generated using the SARAL-ALTIKA waveform data.

          "content": "Home » Data Access » Open Data » Ocean » Global Ocean Surface Current  Global Ocean Surface Current The Global Ocean Surface Current defined here as the average current for the top 0 to 30m layer is derived from the synergistic use of three different satellite derived parameters. The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARAL/ALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products . Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data. Data Version Version 1.0 (beta) Data Sources The daily gridded map of Absolute Dynamic Topography data is obtained from AVISO/DUACS ftp site ( ftp://ftp.aviso.oceanobs.com ) The daily gridded ocean surface vector wind data from ASCAT is obtained from ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/cersat/products/gridded/MWF/L3/ASCAT/Daily The daily gridded SST data of Reynolds OISST is obtained from ftp://eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/OI-daily-v2/NetCDF Data Citation This dataset may be cited as \"MOSDAC ( http://www.mosdac.gov.in )\",(Sikhakolli et al., 2013).

Lett., 4, 335-343, 2013. Processing Steps Using the daily gridded data of MADT, Vector winds and SST data the Geostrophic, wind driven and buoyancy components of the ocean surface current respectively are first calculated for the off-equatorial regions (3°N to 90°N and 3°S to 90°S). Using the polynomial expansion the equatorial currents (±3° latitude band) are derived. The daily ocean surface current at 0.25° resolution is then derived by applying a linear weighted average procedure to the equatorial and off equatorial current solutions with in the latitude band of ± 3° to ± 4° band.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The methodology follows the work of Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U = (u,v) is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate z , and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity A uniform with depth. The vertical shear U z reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z = - H . Using complex notations U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y , the basic equations are if U = - (1/ρ m ) ∇ p + AU z (1a) (1/ρm) p z = -g + ∇θ (1b) ∇θ = g χ T ∇SST , (1c) with - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions U z (z=0) = τ / A (2a) U z (z = -H) = 0 (2b) The characteristic density is ρ m = 1025 kg m -3 , The acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s -2 , and the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10 -4 K -1 , The vector field τ = τ x + i τ y represents the surface wind stress divided by ρ m , H has been chosen to be 70 m, The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1) b | w| 1 m s -1 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 . The equation for the velocity shear is U z - (if/A) U z = (1/A)∇θ (3) which is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions (2a,b). After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is if U 0 = -g ∇ζ + (1/H ) q(H/h e )τ + ((H/2)/q(H/2he))∇θ (4) Here the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and h e = (A/if ) 1/2 is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth h e = sqrt( 2A/|f|). Using equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). Limitations As the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents. Known problems with data As these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.

          "content": " The Global Ocean Surface Current defined here as the average current for the top 0 to 30m layer is derived from the synergistic use of three different satellite derived parameters. The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARAL/ALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products .

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The methodology follows the work of Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U = (u,v) is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate z , and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity A uniform with depth. The vertical shear U z reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z = - H . Using complex notations U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y , the basic equations are if U = - (1/ρ m ) ∇ p + AU z (1a) (1/ρm) p z = -g + ∇θ (1b) ∇θ = g χ T ∇SST , (1c) with - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions U z (z=0) = τ / A (2a) U z (z = -H) = 0 (2b) The characteristic density is ρ m = 1025 kg m -3 , The acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s -2 , and the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10 -4 K -1 , The vector field τ = τ x + i τ y represents the surface wind stress divided by ρ m , H has been chosen to be 70 m, The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1) b | w| 1 m s -1 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 . The equation for the velocity shear is U z - (if/A) U z = (1/A)∇θ (3) which is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions (2a,b). After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is if U 0 = -g ∇ζ + (1/H ) q(H/h e )τ + ((H/2)/q(H/2he))∇θ (4) Here the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and h e = (A/if ) 1/2 is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth h e = sqrt( 2A/|f|). Using equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). Limitations As the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents. Known problems with data As these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.

The primary input datasets utilized are sea surface salinity data from the SMAP mission and sea surface currents derived from altimetry. These datasets are obtained at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The SMAP mission has been operational since 2015, whereas altimetry-derived sea surface currents have been available since 1993. Validation of this reconstructed product was conducted against in-situ datasets obtained from thermo-salinographs. Results indicate that the reconstructed product more accurately captures front formation compared to the original SMAP salinity fields.

Processing Steps i. Remap Sea Surface Currents with a spatial resolution of 5 km. ii. Backward advection of particles from the final time {t} rsub {f} to the initial time {t} rsub {f} -14 , where 14 is the number of days the particles are advected using Runge-Kutta 4th order method. iii. The SMAP Sea Surface Salinity observed at {t} rsub {f} -14 is interpolated onto the particle positions that day. iv. With this, each particle has an SSS value on {t} rsub {f} day that corresponds to the observation at {t} rsub {f} -14 . References [1] Barbara, B., Drushka, K., & Gaube, P.

Limitations This algorithm is applicable only in the region with moderate to high eddy kinetic energy and where lateral advection dominates. High resolution sea surface salinity product generated by Lagrangian technique can have error due to tracer bias (depends on accuracy of initial conditions) and advection bias (Passive stirring can introduce bias due to mixing physics (air-sea fluxes, mixing etc.)). Known problems with data Data sets have biases as well as inaccuracy.

This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically. 7 Dataset Contact Jai Kumar, POD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380015, kumarj@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update Frequency Six months. 9 Access Rights or Restriction Open Access 10 Spatial Resolution Spatial resolution is 10 km 11 Language English 12 Topic Category High resolution sea surface salinity product (SAC-TDP) using satellite data. 13 Keywords Sea surface salinity, sea surface currents, Lagrangian advection technique, high resolution 14 Date or period April 2015 - June 2023 15 Responsible Party Jai Kumar, POD/AOGG/ EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India 16 Organization Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, India 16a Org. role Geophysical parameters from satellite data in the Bay of Bengal region. 16b Individual name Jai Kumar, POD/AOSG/EPSA, SAC (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India.

          "content": " The Bay of Bengal's high-resolution sea surface salinity has been reconstructed using a Lagrangian technique leveraging satellite data. The primary input datasets utilized are sea surface salinity data from the SMAP mission and sea surface currents derived from altimetry. These datasets are obtained at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The SMAP mission has been operational since 2015, whereas altimetry-derived sea surface currents have been available since 1993. Validation of this reconstructed product was conducted against in-situ datasets obtained from thermo-salinographs. Results indicate that the reconstructed product more accurately captures front formation compared to the original SMAP salinity fields.

Data Sources SMAP Sea Surface Salinity ( https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SMAP_JPL_L3_SSS_CAP_8DAY-RUNNINGMEAN_V5 ) Altimetry-derived sea surface currents ( https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047/ ). Processing Steps i. Remap Sea Surface Currents with a spatial resolution of 5 km. ii. Backward advection of particles from the final time {t} rsub {f} to the initial time {t} rsub {f} -14 , where 14 is the number of days the particles are advected using Runge-Kutta 4th order method. iii. The SMAP Sea Surface Salinity observed at {t} rsub {f} -14 is interpolated onto the particle positions that day. iv. With this, each particle has an SSS value on {t} rsub {f} day that corresponds to the observation at {t} rsub {f} -14 . References [1] Barbara, B., Drushka, K., & Gaube, P.

It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product. 7 Dataset Contact Aditya Chaudhary, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015, aditya.osd@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update frequency 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa have been processed.

It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product. 7 Dataset Contact Aditya Chaudhary, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015, aditya.osd@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update frequency 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa have been processed.

Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies. There are 24 files each containing weekly eddy data information for individual year. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products . Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data. Data Version Version 1.0 (beta) Data Sources The daily gridded map of Absolute Dynamic Topography data is obtained from AVISO ftp site ( ftp://ftp.aviso.oceanobs.com ) Website ( http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/ ) Processing Steps Remove the long wavelength component of the SSH anomaly and retain the mesoscale features with the wavelength 50-500 km scale. Identified outer most closed contour of SSH anomaly. The closed contours are sequentially identified, analysed and checked essential criteria. Size and amplitude based thresholds for eddy detection were fixed after carrying out several trials. Eddies are detected and calculated the eddy parameters. Detected eddies are tracked individually. References Chelton, D. B., M. G. Schlax, R. M. Samelson, and R. A. de Szoeke (2007), Global observations of large oceanic eddies, Geophys. Res. Lett., 34, L15606, doi:10.1029/2007GL030812. Derivation Techniques and Algorithm We have followed Chelton et. Al. 2007 in deriving the eddy census in Bay of Bengal with minor modifications in fixing the thresholds for eddy detection specific to this region. This was achieved after performing several trial experiments with different combinations of size and amplitude values. Limitations Accuracy assessment of the dataset has not been carried out. The number of eddies are depending upon the diameter and amplitude threshold. Only mesoscale eddies with maximum diameter of 400km are being considered. Known problems with data Less reliability of SSH data near the coast with altimetry is a known problem. Related data collections http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/registration-form.html File Naming Convention The typical file name is 'eddy_parameter_YYYY.nc' or ‘YYYY.gif’ where 'eddy_parameter’ signifies that this product consists of eddy parameters. 'YYYY' corresponds to the year, ex: 2015. All the data files are in NetCDF 4 format and the images are in gif format.

Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies. There are 24 files each containing weekly eddy data information for individual year. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products . Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data. Data Version Version 1.0 (beta) Data Sources The daily gridded map of Absolute Dynamic Topography data is obtained from AVISO ftp site ( ftp://ftp.aviso.oceanobs.com ) Website ( http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/ ) Processing Steps Remove the long wavelength component of the SSH anomaly and retain the mesoscale features with the wavelength 50-500 km scale. Identified outer most closed contour of SSH anomaly. The closed contours are sequentially identified, analysed and checked essential criteria. Size and amplitude based thresholds for eddy detection were fixed after carrying out several trials. Eddies are detected and calculated the eddy parameters. Detected eddies are tracked individually.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm We have followed Chelton et. Al. 2007 in deriving the eddy census in Bay of Bengal with minor modifications in fixing the thresholds for eddy detection specific to this region. This was achieved after performing several trial experiments with different combinations of size and amplitude values. Limitations Accuracy assessment of the dataset has not been carried out. The number of eddies are depending upon the diameter and amplitude threshold. Only mesoscale eddies with maximum diameter of 400km are being considered. Known problems with data Less reliability of SSH data near the coast with altimetry is a known problem.

Accurate and timely advance prediction of tropical cyclones is very important to disseminate the warnings and preparedness. Prediction of development of any cyclone system in the North Indian Ocean is being done at Space Applications Centre (ISRO) Ahmedabad, using the in-house developed algorithms. Once the low-pressure system is formed, it is continuously monitored by satellite observations. The forecasts like cyclogenesis, track, intensity and landfall of cyclones, ship avoidance region, storm surge, coastal inundation etc. and satellite based cyclone information are disseminated through web-portal SCORPIO.

Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency.

Ocean meso-scale variability is defined as a class of high-energy processes, with wave lengths within a 50km to 500km range, and with periods of a few days to one year. Kinetic energy of mesoscale variability is one order of magnitude more than mean circulation's one. Description of mesoscale is thus essential for understanding ocean dynamics, including mean circulation and its climatic effects (through interactions of meso-scale turbulence with the mean flow). SARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is divided in sub-themes including: Intrinsic scientific studies of ocean at meso-scale dynamics: observations, theoretical analyses, modelling, data assimilation, parameterization, ... Improvement of our understanding of the oceanic component in the climate system: investigation of local processes at small or medium scale poorly known and understood at present, but which have an impact on the modelling of climate variability at large spatial and temporal scales. Contribution to the study of coastal dynamic processes, especially small or medium scale phenomena, whose retrieval will enable to anticipate many downstream applications. Contribution to operational oceanography which is seeking large amounts of in situ and space observation data. SARAL/AltiKa secondary objectives are notably the monitoring of the main continental waters level (lakes, rivers, closed seas), the monitoring of mean sea level variations, the observation of polar oceans, the analysis and forecast of wave and wind fields, the study of continental ices (thanks to improved performances of Ka-band) and sea ices, the access to low rains climatology (enabled in counterpart to the sensitivity of Ka-band to clouds and low rains) and the marine biogeochemistry (notably through the role of the meso and sub-meso-scale physics).

IMAGER The INSAT-3D imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band. T he Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution. This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors. Key Parameters of the Imager Telescope aperture 310 mm diameter Number of bands (6) 0.52 - 0.72 µm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 µm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 µm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 µm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 µm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 µm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared) Spatial resolution 1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2 Band separation, band definition Beam splitter, interference filters IFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) 28 µrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 µrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 µrad for WV (8 km) Sampling interval 1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV Scan step angle Linear in E-W direction (8 µR step size) Line step 224 µrad in N-S direction Scan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration 200º/s +0.2 s turnaround time 56 µR (peak to peak) Full aperture blackbody and spaceview Scan modes Full, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity Frame time 25 minutes for normal mode Signal quantization 10 bit/sample Downlink data rate 4.0 Mbit/s SOUNDER The INSAT-3D sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere. T he Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.

IMAGER The INSAT-3DR imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band. T he Imager is an improved design of VHRR-2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution. This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors. The INSAT-3DR Imager payload is a replica of INSAT-3D Imager. Key Parameters of the Imager Telescope aperture 310 mm diameter Number of bands (6) 0.52 - 0.72 µm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 µm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 µm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 µm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 µm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 µm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared) Spatial resolution 1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2 Band separation, band definition Beam splitter, interference filters IFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) 28 µrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 µrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 µrad for WV (8 km) Sampling interval 1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV Scan step angle Linear in E-W direction (8 µR step size) Line step 224 µrad in N-S direction Scan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration 200º/s +0.2 s turnaround time 56 µR (peak to peak) Full aperture blackbody and spaceview Scan modes Full, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity Frame time 25 minutes for normal mode Signal quantization 10 bit/sample Downlink data rate 4.0 Mbit/s SOUNDER The INSAT-3DR sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands alongwith one visible band. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional maps of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere. T he Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.

The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, in its 37th flight, (PSLV-C35) launched the satellites at 9:12 hours on September 26, 2016 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The 377 kg SCATSAT-1 satellite have satellites from Algeria, Canada and USA, as well as two satellites from Indian Universities as its co-passengers. SCATSAT-1 is placed into a 720 km Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit, whereas the two Universities' satellites and the five foreign satellites are placed into a 670 km polar orbit. This PSLV mission is unique in itself as it is for the first time that its payloads are placed into two different orbits. PSLV-C35 launched from the First Launch Pad (FLP) of Satish Dhawan Space Centre and is the 15th flight of PSLV in 'XL' configuration (with the use of solid strap-on motors).

Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) SCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at SAC/ISRO, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 25 x 25 km. The parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90 0 and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60 0 on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively.

Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA) Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) OCM is an 8-band multi-spectral camera operating in the Visible and Near IR spectral range. This camera provides an instantaneous geometric field of view of 360 meter and a swath of 1420 km. OCM can be tilted up to + 20 degree along track. Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) SCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90 0 and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60 0 on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days. Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA) ROSA is a new GPS occultation receiver provided by ASI (Italian Space Agency). The objective is to characterize the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, opening the possibilities for the development of several scientific activities exploiting these new radio occultation data sets.

IMAGER The INSAT-3DS imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band. T he Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution. This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors.

A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere. T he Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.

          "content": "Home » Missions » MeghaTropiques » Introduction  Megha Tropiques Introduction The tropical belt receives more energy from Sun than it radiates back into space. The excess energy is transported to temperate regions by the motion of atmosphere and oceans. Any variation in the energy budget of the tropics will therefore effect the whole planet. The energy exchanges are strongly linked to the water cycle and particularly to the tropical connective systems: huge amount of latent heat are released in the tropical rains, while high humidity and thick clouds strongly affect the radiation budget. Many interactions between radiation, water vapour, clouds, precipitation and atmospheric motion determine the life cycle of convective cloud systems, and the occurrence of extreme events like tropical cyclones, monsoons, flood and droughts. Due to dynamic nature of above parameters, the frequency of observation from low orbiting sun-synchronous orbits is inadequate. Only geo-stationary satellites allow continuous monitoring of the Tropics, but their Vis-IR sensors give limited information on the cloud surface properties or horizontal distribution of water vapour. Low orbiting (~800 km) satellites with low inclinations provide high repetitivity. An inclination at 20 degrees provides 6 observations of each point on the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The most energetic tropical systems, such as the cloud clusters of ITCZ, the Monsoon systems and the Tropical cyclones, extend over hundreds of kilometers. Hence, a ground resolution of about 10 km is adequate for these observations. In order to meet most of the above requirements, Megha Tropiques has been envisaged which is low earth orbit (LEO) mission. Megha in Sanskrit is ‘cloud’ and Tropiques in French is ‘tropics’. Megha-tropiques Mission is an ISRO-CNES (Indo-French) collaborative programme intended for studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics using a satellite platform. Megha-Tropiques is a one-tonne satellite which will be operated as part of a joint programme between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and France′s Centre National d′Etudes Spaciales (CNES). The spacecraft was constructed by ISRO, based around the IRS bus developed for earlier Indian satellites, and carries four instruments which will be used to study the Earth′s atmosphere. ISRO is responsible of the system and the satellite. ISRO provides the launcher, the paltform, part of the MADRAS instrument, the GPS receiver and the mission operation center, which will process all the products until level 1. ISRO also performs the integration and test of the MADRAS instrument, of the complete payload and of the satellite. CNES provides a support for the system activities, the hyperfrequency part of the MADRAS instrument (MARFEQ) developped under contract by ASTRIUM, and the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments developped by CNES with a support of the LMD, LERMA and CETP laboratories. CNES also provides the data processing algorithms for the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments and participates to the development of the MADRAS data processing algorithms. A data and instruments performances expertise center will be created in France. For the French part, the level 2 and upper data processing will be realised in the thematic center Icare. Megha Tropiques Ground Segment The ground segment is divided into: 1. A satellite operation ground segment providedby India: an S-band telemetry and command station a satellite monitoring and control center 2. A science ground segment including Indian and French parts: an S-band mission station for payload telemetry located in India a mission operation center located in India a level-2 processing center in India such as MOSDAC a level-2 processing center named ICARE in France The Megha-Tropiques satellite is launched by an Indian PSLV launcher in 2011, on a 867 km orbit with an inclination of 20°.

It carries twenty four transponders - twelve operating in the normal C-band frequency, six in Extended C-band and six in Ku-band. Nine of the twelve normal C-band transponders provide expanded coverage and the remaining three have India coverage beam. All the extended C-band as well as the Ku-band transponders has India coverage beams. INSAT-3A also carries a Ku-band beacon. For meteorological observation, INSAT-3A carries a three channel Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) with 2 km resolution in the visible band and 8 km resolution in thermal infrared and water vapour bands. In addition, INSAT-3A carries a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera which operates in the visible and short wave infrared bands providing a spatial resolution of 1 km. A Data Relay Transponder (DRT) operating in UHF band is incorporated for realtime hydro-meteorological data collection from unattended platforms located on land and river basins. The data is then relayed in extended C-band to a central location. INSAT-3A also carries another transponder for Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS & R) as part of India's contribution to the international Satellite Aided Search and Rescue programme. INSAT-3A was launched by European Ariane-5G Launch Vehicle into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) with a perigee of 200 km and an apogee of 35,980 km. The satellite is maneuvered to its final orbit by firing the satellite's apogee motor.

This tool allows you to download satellite data seamlessly using a simple configuration fileâ€” config.json . Once you have filled out this file correctly according to your download requirements, simply run the script mdapi.py . No need to modify any code! This manual will provide you step-by-step guide to download data though \" MOSDAC Data Download API \". 1. Prerequisites: For running this application, you will need following things: i .   Python (Version 3+) ii. Python Library: 'requests' iii. MOSDAC Account credentials (Refer section 5 for ' Authentication ' ) iv. 'datasetId' (Refer section 5 for ' How to find your DatasetId (datasetId) ?' ) Optional Requirement: i. Python Library: 'tqdm' Steps to Install Python Libraries: Requests: i. Check if you have the 'requests' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show requests If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. ii. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install requests This will successfully install the 'requests' module in your system. You can follow the first step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. Tqdm (Optional): iii. Check if you have the 'tqdm' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show tqdm If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. iv. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install tqdm This will successfully install the 'requests'module in your system. You can follow the previous step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. [ Hint : Although not a requirement, installing the Python library - 'tqdm', will provide an enhanced download experience by providing a well-structured 'Progress Bar' while downloading data, providing a clean and visually appealing download process.] 2. How to Download, Install & Run: i. Download 'mdapi' from: https://mosdac.gov.in/software/mdapi.zip ii. Unzip the folder in your desired directory. One will find the following files: a. mdapi.py b. config.json Following is the structure of config.json: { \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" }, \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"\", \"startTime\": \"\", \"endTime\": \"\", \"count\": \"\", \"boundingBox\": \"\", \"gId\": \"\" }, \"download_settings\": { \"download_path\": \"\", \"organize_by_date\":false, \"skip_user_prompt\":false, \"generate_error_log\":false, \"error_log_path\": \"\" } } [ Important Tip : Make sure you don't change the name of your Configuration File, i.e. - 'config.json'. Doing so will prevent successful execution of your 'mdapi.py' code, as the name of the Configuration file is already pre-configured inside it.] iii. Edit config.json correctly as per your data requirement, along with your user credentials. ( Refer section: ' Parameter Reference of config.json ' ) iv. In your terminal, run: python mdapi.py v. After fetching the search results, you will see the following message: (If skip_user_prompt is set false ) Do you want to start downloading? (Y/N): vi. Type Y (or Yes) and hit Enter to start the download process. vii. After the Download is complete, you will see a logout message, containing: Download Complete! Logout Successful. Goodbye (your_username) ! [ Background Download : For background downloading set 'skip_user_input' as - true in your 'config.json' file. This will start data download without user interaction.] [ Daily Download Limit : We allow users to download a maximum of 5000 data files per day, per user. If your download exceeds that limit, you will see the message: 'You have reached your Daily Download Quota (5000 per day)' and will be automatically logged out. You will have to wait until the next day if you want to download more data.] 3. Data Download Workflow: Data download workflow includes the following steps to download data through MOSDAC: i. Data Search : Based on the input provided by the user in 'search_parameter' of 'client.json', our application will first fetch the total available files count and their total size. For this, one should know the required 'datasetId'. (Refer section 4 for details) ii. Authentication process : Once the search results are retrieved, if the user provides the input to proceed for download, user authentication takes place. (Refer section 5 for details) iii. Data download : After successful authentication, the data download begins as per user defined configuration. iv . Logout : After completion of the entire process, the user is logged out automatically. 4. Searching data: You don't need to log in to search; an account is only required to download data . If your goal is just to search or preview available datasets using filters like datasetId , startTime , or boundingBox , etc., you can leave the 'user_credentials' blank. No authentication is needed in that case. However, DatasetId is required for search. Following section will guide you how to find your DatasetId: How to Find Your Dataset ID ( datasetId )? In the config.json file, under the search_parameters section, there is a required field called datasetId . This field specifies which dataset you want to download from , and it is mandatory for the application to fetch any data. Where to Find Available Dataset IDs You can explore the available dataset IDs here: Browse datasets : https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php On this page, you can: Browse or filter datasets based on: o Satellite o Sensor o Search Find your desired Product Name (Eg: 3SIMG_L1B_STD, E06OCM_L2C_AD ) , which corresponds to the datasetId you should enter in your config file. Example Workflow i. Visit the dataset browser: https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php ii. Use filters to narrow down your options by satellite, sensor, etc. iii. Identify the product you're interested in. iv. Copy the Product Name exactly as shown - this is your datasetId . Example: If the product name is 3SIMG_L1B_STD , then your config should include: \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1B_STD\" Tip: Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces in the datasetId . It must match the platform's listing exactly . 5. Authentication and Account Requirements To download any data using this application, you must first authenticate yourself using valid credentials. Authentication Process The application uses your MOSDAC Account credentials (username and password) to authenticate your session before downloading begins. These credentials must be provided in the config.json file under the user_credentials section: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Important: Without valid credentials, you will not be able to download any data. Don't Have an Account? If you donâ€™t already have an account, you must create one first: Create your account here : https://mosdac.gov.in/signup/ Once your registration is complete and your account is approved , you will be eligible to use the application for downloading datasets. Forgot Your Password? You can reset your password here: Reset your password : https://mosdac.gov.in/auth/realms/Mosdac/login-actions/reset-credentials Failed Login Attempts If you enter incorrect credentials three times consecutively , your account will be temporarily locked for 1 hour . Please double-check your username and password before running the script to avoid triggering this lockout.

          "content": "Home » Data Access » API based Access  User Manual for MOSDAC Data Download API Overview: Welcome to the User Manual for MOSDAC Data Download API ! This tool allows you to download satellite data seamlessly using a simple configuration fileâ€” config.json . Once you have filled out this file correctly according to your download requirements, simply run the script mdapi.py . No need to modify any code! This manual will provide you step-by-step guide to download data though \" MOSDAC Data Download API \". 1. Prerequisites: For running this application, you will need following things: i .   Python (Version 3+) ii. Python Library: 'requests' iii. MOSDAC Account credentials (Refer section 5 for ' Authentication ' ) iv. 'datasetId' (Refer section 5 for ' How to find your DatasetId (datasetId) ?' ) Optional Requirement: i. Python Library: 'tqdm' Steps to Install Python Libraries: Requests: i. Check if you have the 'requests' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show requests If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. ii. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install requests This will successfully install the 'requests' module in your system. You can follow the first step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. Tqdm (Optional): iii. Check if you have the 'tqdm' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show tqdm If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. iv. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install tqdm This will successfully install the 'requests'module in your system. You can follow the previous step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. [ Hint : Although not a requirement, installing the Python library - 'tqdm', will provide an enhanced download experience by providing a well-structured 'Progress Bar' while downloading data, providing a clean and visually appealing download process.] 2. How to Download, Install & Run: i. Download 'mdapi' from: https://mosdac.gov.in/software/mdapi.zip ii. Unzip the folder in your desired directory. One will find the following files: a. mdapi.py b. config.json Following is the structure of config.json: { \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" }, \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"\", \"startTime\": \"\", \"endTime\": \"\", \"count\": \"\", \"boundingBox\": \"\", \"gId\": \"\" }, \"download_settings\": { \"download_path\": \"\", \"organize_by_date\":false, \"skip_user_prompt\":false, \"generate_error_log\":false, \"error_log_path\": \"\" } } [ Important Tip : Make sure you don't change the name of your Configuration File, i.e. - 'config.json'. Doing so will prevent successful execution of your 'mdapi.py' code, as the name of the Configuration file is already pre-configured inside it.] iii. Edit config.json correctly as per your data requirement, along with your user credentials. ( Refer section: ' Parameter Reference of config.json ' ) iv. In your terminal, run: python mdapi.py v. After fetching the search results, you will see the following message: (If skip_user_prompt is set false ) Do you want to start downloading? (Y/N): vi. Type Y (or Yes) and hit Enter to start the download process. vii. After the Download is complete, you will see a logout message, containing: Download Complete! Logout Successful. Goodbye (your_username) ! [ Background Download : For background downloading set 'skip_user_input' as - true in your 'config.json' file. This will start data download without user interaction.] [ Daily Download Limit : We allow users to download a maximum of 5000 data files per day, per user. If your download exceeds that limit, you will see the message: 'You have reached your Daily Download Quota (5000 per day)' and will be automatically logged out. You will have to wait until the next day if you want to download more data.] 3. Data Download Workflow: Data download workflow includes the following steps to download data through MOSDAC: i. Data Search : Based on the input provided by the user in 'search_parameter' of 'client.json', our application will first fetch the total available files count and their total size. For this, one should know the required 'datasetId'. (Refer section 4 for details) ii. Authentication process : Once the search results are retrieved, if the user provides the input to proceed for download, user authentication takes place. (Refer section 5 for details) iii. Data download : After successful authentication, the data download begins as per user defined configuration. iv . Logout : After completion of the entire process, the user is logged out automatically. 4. Searching data: You don't need to log in to search; an account is only required to download data . If your goal is just to search or preview available datasets using filters like datasetId , startTime , or boundingBox , etc., you can leave the 'user_credentials' blank. No authentication is needed in that case. However, DatasetId is required for search. Following section will guide you how to find your DatasetId: How to Find Your Dataset ID ( datasetId )? In the config.json file, under the search_parameters section, there is a required field called datasetId . This field specifies which dataset you want to download from , and it is mandatory for the application to fetch any data. Where to Find Available Dataset IDs You can explore the available dataset IDs here: Browse datasets : https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php On this page, you can: Browse or filter datasets based on: o Satellite o Sensor o Search Find your desired Product Name (Eg: 3SIMG_L1B_STD, E06OCM_L2C_AD ) , which corresponds to the datasetId you should enter in your config file. Example Workflow i. Visit the dataset browser: https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php ii. Use filters to narrow down your options by satellite, sensor, etc. iii. Identify the product you're interested in. iv. Copy the Product Name exactly as shown - this is your datasetId . Example: If the product name is 3SIMG_L1B_STD , then your config should include: \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1B_STD\" Tip: Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces in the datasetId . It must match the platform's listing exactly . 5. Authentication and Account Requirements To download any data using this application, you must first authenticate yourself using valid credentials. Authentication Process The application uses your MOSDAC Account credentials (username and password) to authenticate your session before downloading begins. These credentials must be provided in the config.json file under the user_credentials section: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Important: Without valid credentials, you will not be able to download any data. Don't Have an Account? If you donâ€™t already have an account, you must create one first: Create your account here : https://mosdac.gov.in/signup/ Once your registration is complete and your account is approved , you will be eligible to use the application for downloading datasets. Forgot Your Password? You can reset your password here: Reset your password : https://mosdac.gov.in/auth/realms/Mosdac/login-actions/reset-credentials Failed Login Attempts If you enter incorrect credentials three times consecutively , your account will be temporarily locked for 1 hour . Please double-check your username and password before running the script to avoid triggering this lockout.

Once you have filled out this file correctly according to your download requirements, simply run the script mdapi.py . No need to modify any code! This manual will provide you step-by-step guide to download data though \" MOSDAC Data Download API \". 1. Prerequisites: For running this application, you will need following things: i .   Python (Version 3+) ii. Python Library: 'requests' iii. MOSDAC Account credentials (Refer section 5 for ' Authentication ' ) iv. 'datasetId' (Refer section 5 for ' How to find your DatasetId (datasetId) ?' ) Optional Requirement: i. Python Library: 'tqdm' Steps to Install Python Libraries: Requests: i. Check if you have the 'requests' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show requests If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. ii. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install requests This will successfully install the 'requests' module in your system. You can follow the first step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. Tqdm (Optional): iii. Check if you have the 'tqdm' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show tqdm If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. iv. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install tqdm This will successfully install the 'requests'module in your system. You can follow the previous step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. [ Hint : Although not a requirement, installing the Python library - 'tqdm', will provide an enhanced download experience by providing a well-structured 'Progress Bar' while downloading data, providing a clean and visually appealing download process.] 2. How to Download, Install & Run: i. Download 'mdapi' from: https://mosdac.gov.in/software/mdapi.zip ii. Unzip the folder in your desired directory. One will find the following files: a. mdapi.py b. config.json Following is the structure of config.json: { \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" }, \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"\", \"startTime\": \"\", \"endTime\": \"\", \"count\": \"\", \"boundingBox\": \"\", \"gId\": \"\" }, \"download_settings\": { \"download_path\": \"\", \"organize_by_date\":false, \"skip_user_prompt\":false, \"generate_error_log\":false, \"error_log_path\": \"\" } } [ Important Tip : Make sure you don't change the name of your Configuration File, i.e. - 'config.json'. Doing so will prevent successful execution of your 'mdapi.py' code, as the name of the Configuration file is already pre-configured inside it.] iii. Edit config.json correctly as per your data requirement, along with your user credentials. ( Refer section: ' Parameter Reference of config.json ' ) iv. In your terminal, run: python mdapi.py v. After fetching the search results, you will see the following message: (If skip_user_prompt is set false ) Do you want to start downloading? (Y/N): vi. Type Y (or Yes) and hit Enter to start the download process. vii. After the Download is complete, you will see a logout message, containing: Download Complete! Logout Successful. Goodbye (your_username) ! [ Background Download : For background downloading set 'skip_user_input' as - true in your 'config.json' file. This will start data download without user interaction.] [ Daily Download Limit : We allow users to download a maximum of 5000 data files per day, per user. If your download exceeds that limit, you will see the message: 'You have reached your Daily Download Quota (5000 per day)' and will be automatically logged out. You will have to wait until the next day if you want to download more data.] 3. Data Download Workflow: Data download workflow includes the following steps to download data through MOSDAC: i. Data Search : Based on the input provided by the user in 'search_parameter' of 'client.json', our application will first fetch the total available files count and their total size. For this, one should know the required 'datasetId'. (Refer section 4 for details) ii. Authentication process : Once the search results are retrieved, if the user provides the input to proceed for download, user authentication takes place. (Refer section 5 for details) iii. Data download : After successful authentication, the data download begins as per user defined configuration. iv . Logout : After completion of the entire process, the user is logged out automatically. 4. Searching data: You don't need to log in to search; an account is only required to download data . If your goal is just to search or preview available datasets using filters like datasetId , startTime , or boundingBox , etc., you can leave the 'user_credentials' blank. No authentication is needed in that case. However, DatasetId is required for search. Following section will guide you how to find your DatasetId: How to Find Your Dataset ID ( datasetId )? In the config.json file, under the search_parameters section, there is a required field called datasetId . This field specifies which dataset you want to download from , and it is mandatory for the application to fetch any data. Where to Find Available Dataset IDs You can explore the available dataset IDs here: Browse datasets : https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php On this page, you can: Browse or filter datasets based on: o Satellite o Sensor o Search Find your desired Product Name (Eg: 3SIMG_L1B_STD, E06OCM_L2C_AD ) , which corresponds to the datasetId you should enter in your config file. Example Workflow i. Visit the dataset browser: https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php ii. Use filters to narrow down your options by satellite, sensor, etc. iii. Identify the product you're interested in. iv. Copy the Product Name exactly as shown - this is your datasetId . Example: If the product name is 3SIMG_L1B_STD , then your config should include: \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1B_STD\" Tip: Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces in the datasetId . It must match the platform's listing exactly . 5. Authentication and Account Requirements To download any data using this application, you must first authenticate yourself using valid credentials. Authentication Process The application uses your MOSDAC Account credentials (username and password) to authenticate your session before downloading begins. These credentials must be provided in the config.json file under the user_credentials section: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Important: Without valid credentials, you will not be able to download any data. Don't Have an Account? If you donâ€™t already have an account, you must create one first: Create your account here : https://mosdac.gov.in/signup/ Once your registration is complete and your account is approved , you will be eligible to use the application for downloading datasets. Forgot Your Password? You can reset your password here: Reset your password : https://mosdac.gov.in/auth/realms/Mosdac/login-actions/reset-credentials Failed Login Attempts If you enter incorrect credentials three times consecutively , your account will be temporarily locked for 1 hour . Please double-check your username and password before running the script to avoid triggering this lockout. Appendix: Parameter Reference of Config.json A. user_credentials: Field Description Required username Your username for MOSDAC login (*) Yes password Your password for MOSDAC login (*) Yes Correct Example: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Incorrect Example : \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" } (Both fields must be filled in correctly for authentication to succeed.) B. search_parameters: Field Description Required Notes datasetId The dataset that you want to download Yes Example: \" 3SIMG_L1B_STD \" startTime he start date from which data should be downloaded. No Format: \"YYYY-MM-DD\" Example: \"2024-09-25\" endTime The end date up to which data should be downloaded. No Format: \"YYYY-MM-DD\" Example: \"2024-10-25\" count Maximum number of records you want to download. No Max value: 100 boundingBox Area-wise filter your selected â€˜datasetIdâ€™. No Format: \"minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat\" Example: \"70.0,8.0,90.0,28.0\" gId Granule ID (specific ID if only one file is to be downloaded.) No Must be exact. Example: \"15039367\" [ Tip: Although not required, we recommend setting the 'startTime' and 'endTime' according to your requirement, otherwise the search API will fetch results of the entire lifespan of the provided dataset.] Correct Example: \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1B_STD\", \"startTime\": \"2024-10-25\", \"endTime\": \"2025-03-27\", \"count\": \"50\", \"boundingBox\": \"70.0,8.0,90.0,28.0\", \"gId\": \"\" } Incorrect Example : \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1\", // Incorrect/Incomplete datasetId value \"startTime\": \"25-10-2024\", //Incorrect Date Format \"endTime\": \"2023-10-25â€™, // endTime > startTime \"count\": \"500\", // Count > Max Count \"boundingBox\": \"70.0, 8.0\", // Incorrect boundingBox Format \"gId\": \"1437ZBL1\" // Incorrect gId value } C. download_settings (Optional) Customize how downloads and logging behave. Not mandatory to be set.

The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget, Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and  Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR  provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels.  A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation.

          "content": "Home » Data Access » API based Access  User Manual for MOSDAC Data Download API Overview: Welcome to the User Manual for MOSDAC Data Download API ! This tool allows you to download satellite data seamlessly using a simple configuration fileâ€” config.json . Once you have filled out this file correctly according to your download requirements, simply run the script mdapi.py . No need to modify any code! This manual will provide you step-by-step guide to download data though \" MOSDAC Data Download API \". 1. Prerequisites: For running this application, you will need following things: i .   Python (Version 3+) ii. Python Library: 'requests' iii. MOSDAC Account credentials (Refer section 5 for ' Authentication ' ) iv. 'datasetId' (Refer section 5 for ' How to find your DatasetId (datasetId) ?' ) Optional Requirement: i. Python Library: 'tqdm' Steps to Install Python Libraries: Requests: i. Check if you have the 'requests' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show requests If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. ii. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install requests This will successfully install the 'requests' module in your system. You can follow the first step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. Tqdm (Optional): iii. Check if you have the 'tqdm' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show tqdm If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. iv. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install tqdm This will successfully install the 'requests'module in your system. You can follow the previous step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. [ Hint : Although not a requirement, installing the Python library - 'tqdm', will provide an enhanced download experience by providing a well-structured 'Progress Bar' while downloading data, providing a clean and visually appealing download process.] 2. How to Download, Install & Run: i. Download 'mdapi' from: https://mosdac.gov.in/software/mdapi.zip ii. Unzip the folder in your desired directory. One will find the following files: a. mdapi.py b. config.json Following is the structure of config.json: { \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" }, \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"\", \"startTime\": \"\", \"endTime\": \"\", \"count\": \"\", \"boundingBox\": \"\", \"gId\": \"\" }, \"download_settings\": { \"download_path\": \"\", \"organize_by_date\":false, \"skip_user_prompt\":false, \"generate_error_log\":false, \"error_log_path\": \"\" } } [ Important Tip : Make sure you don't change the name of your Configuration File, i.e. - 'config.json'. Doing so will prevent successful execution of your 'mdapi.py' code, as the name of the Configuration file is already pre-configured inside it.] iii. Edit config.json correctly as per your data requirement, along with your user credentials. ( Refer section: ' Parameter Reference of config.json ' ) iv. In your terminal, run: python mdapi.py v. After fetching the search results, you will see the following message: (If skip_user_prompt is set false ) Do you want to start downloading? (Y/N): vi. Type Y (or Yes) and hit Enter to start the download process. vii. After the Download is complete, you will see a logout message, containing: Download Complete! Logout Successful. Goodbye (your_username) ! [ Background Download : For background downloading set 'skip_user_input' as - true in your 'config.json' file. This will start data download without user interaction.] [ Daily Download Limit : We allow users to download a maximum of 5000 data files per day, per user. If your download exceeds that limit, you will see the message: 'You have reached your Daily Download Quota (5000 per day)' and will be automatically logged out. You will have to wait until the next day if you want to download more data.] 3. Data Download Workflow: Data download workflow includes the following steps to download data through MOSDAC: i. Data Search : Based on the input provided by the user in 'search_parameter' of 'client.json', our application will first fetch the total available files count and their total size. For this, one should know the required 'datasetId'. (Refer section 4 for details) ii. Authentication process : Once the search results are retrieved, if the user provides the input to proceed for download, user authentication takes place. (Refer section 5 for details) iii. Data download : After successful authentication, the data download begins as per user defined configuration. iv . Logout : After completion of the entire process, the user is logged out automatically. 4. Searching data: You don't need to log in to search; an account is only required to download data . If your goal is just to search or preview available datasets using filters like datasetId , startTime , or boundingBox , etc., you can leave the 'user_credentials' blank. No authentication is needed in that case. However, DatasetId is required for search. Following section will guide you how to find your DatasetId: How to Find Your Dataset ID ( datasetId )? In the config.json file, under the search_parameters section, there is a required field called datasetId . This field specifies which dataset you want to download from , and it is mandatory for the application to fetch any data. Where to Find Available Dataset IDs You can explore the available dataset IDs here: Browse datasets : https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php On this page, you can: Browse or filter datasets based on: o Satellite o Sensor o Search Find your desired Product Name (Eg: 3SIMG_L1B_STD, E06OCM_L2C_AD ) , which corresponds to the datasetId you should enter in your config file. Example Workflow i. Visit the dataset browser: https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php ii. Use filters to narrow down your options by satellite, sensor, etc. iii. Identify the product you're interested in. iv. Copy the Product Name exactly as shown - this is your datasetId . Example: If the product name is 3SIMG_L1B_STD , then your config should include: \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1B_STD\" Tip: Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces in the datasetId . It must match the platform's listing exactly . 5. Authentication and Account Requirements To download any data using this application, you must first authenticate yourself using valid credentials. Authentication Process The application uses your MOSDAC Account credentials (username and password) to authenticate your session before downloading begins. These credentials must be provided in the config.json file under the user_credentials section: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Important: Without valid credentials, you will not be able to download any data. Don't Have an Account? If you donâ€™t already have an account, you must create one first: Create your account here : https://mosdac.gov.in/signup/ Once your registration is complete and your account is approved , you will be eligible to use the application for downloading datasets. Forgot Your Password? You can reset your password here: Reset your password : https://mosdac.gov.in/auth/realms/Mosdac/login-actions/reset-credentials Failed Login Attempts If you enter incorrect credentials three times consecutively , your account will be temporarily locked for 1 hour . Please double-check your username and password before running the script to avoid triggering this lockout. Appendix: Parameter Reference of Config.json A. user_credentials: Field Description Required username Your username for MOSDAC login (*) Yes password Your password for MOSDAC login (*) Yes Correct Example: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Incorrect Example : \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" } (Both fields must be filled in correctly for authentication to succeed.)

          "content": " Overview: Welcome to the User Manual for MOSDAC Data Download API ! This tool allows you to download satellite data seamlessly using a simple configuration fileâ€” config.json . Once you have filled out this file correctly according to your download requirements, simply run the script mdapi.py . No need to modify any code! This manual will provide you step-by-step guide to download data though \" MOSDAC Data Download API \". 1. Prerequisites: For running this application, you will need following things: i .   Python (Version 3+) ii. Python Library: 'requests' iii. MOSDAC Account credentials (Refer section 5 for ' Authentication ' ) iv. 'datasetId' (Refer section 5 for ' How to find your DatasetId (datasetId) ?' ) Optional Requirement: i. Python Library: 'tqdm' Steps to Install Python Libraries: Requests: i. Check if you have the 'requests' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show requests If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. ii. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install requests This will successfully install the 'requests' module in your system. You can follow the first step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. Tqdm (Optional): iii. Check if you have the 'tqdm' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show tqdm If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. iv. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install tqdm This will successfully install the 'requests'module in your system. You can follow the previous step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. [ Hint : Although not a requirement, installing the Python library - 'tqdm', will provide an enhanced download experience by providing a well-structured 'Progress Bar' while downloading data, providing a clean and visually appealing download process.] 2. How to Download, Install & Run: i. Download 'mdapi' from: https://mosdac.gov.in/software/mdapi.zip ii. Unzip the folder in your desired directory. One will find the following files: a. mdapi.py b. config.json Following is the structure of config.json: { \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" }, \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"\", \"startTime\": \"\", \"endTime\": \"\", \"count\": \"\", \"boundingBox\": \"\", \"gId\": \"\" }, \"download_settings\": { \"download_path\": \"\", \"organize_by_date\":false, \"skip_user_prompt\":false, \"generate_error_log\":false, \"error_log_path\": \"\" } } [ Important Tip : Make sure you don't change the name of your Configuration File, i.e. - 'config.json'. Doing so will prevent successful execution of your 'mdapi.py' code, as the name of the Configuration file is already pre-configured inside it.] iii. Edit config.json correctly as per your data requirement, along with your user credentials. ( Refer section: ' Parameter Reference of config.json ' ) iv. In your terminal, run: python mdapi.py v. After fetching the search results, you will see the following message: (If skip_user_prompt is set false ) Do you want to start downloading? (Y/N): vi. Type Y (or Yes) and hit Enter to start the download process. vii. After the Download is complete, you will see a logout message, containing: Download Complete! Logout Successful. Goodbye (your_username) ! [ Background Download : For background downloading set 'skip_user_input' as - true in your 'config.json' file. This will start data download without user interaction.] [ Daily Download Limit : We allow users to download a maximum of 5000 data files per day, per user. If your download exceeds that limit, you will see the message: 'You have reached your Daily Download Quota (5000 per day)' and will be automatically logged out. You will have to wait until the next day if you want to download more data.] 3. Data Download Workflow: Data download workflow includes the following steps to download data through MOSDAC: i. Data Search : Based on the input provided by the user in 'search_parameter' of 'client.json', our application will first fetch the total available files count and their total size. For this, one should know the required 'datasetId'. (Refer section 4 for details) ii. Authentication process : Once the search results are retrieved, if the user provides the input to proceed for download, user authentication takes place. (Refer section 5 for details) iii. Data download : After successful authentication, the data download begins as per user defined configuration. iv . Logout : After completion of the entire process, the user is logged out automatically. 4. Searching data: You don't need to log in to search; an account is only required to download data . If your goal is just to search or preview available datasets using filters like datasetId , startTime , or boundingBox , etc., you can leave the 'user_credentials' blank. No authentication is needed in that case. However, DatasetId is required for search. Following section will guide you how to find your DatasetId: How to Find Your Dataset ID ( datasetId )? In the config.json file, under the search_parameters section, there is a required field called datasetId . This field specifies which dataset you want to download from , and it is mandatory for the application to fetch any data. Where to Find Available Dataset IDs You can explore the available dataset IDs here: Browse datasets : https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php On this page, you can: Browse or filter datasets based on: o Satellite o Sensor o Search Find your desired Product Name (Eg: 3SIMG_L1B_STD, E06OCM_L2C_AD ) , which corresponds to the datasetId you should enter in your config file. Example Workflow i. Visit the dataset browser: https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php ii. Use filters to narrow down your options by satellite, sensor, etc. iii. Identify the product you're interested in. iv. Copy the Product Name exactly as shown - this is your datasetId . Example: If the product name is 3SIMG_L1B_STD , then your config should include: \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1B_STD\" Tip: Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces in the datasetId . It must match the platform's listing exactly . 5. Authentication and Account Requirements To download any data using this application, you must first authenticate yourself using valid credentials. Authentication Process The application uses your MOSDAC Account credentials (username and password) to authenticate your session before downloading begins. These credentials must be provided in the config.json file under the user_credentials section: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Important: Without valid credentials, you will not be able to download any data. Don't Have an Account? If you donâ€™t already have an account, you must create one first: Create your account here : https://mosdac.gov.in/signup/ Once your registration is complete and your account is approved , you will be eligible to use the application for downloading datasets. Forgot Your Password? You can reset your password here: Reset your password : https://mosdac.gov.in/auth/realms/Mosdac/login-actions/reset-credentials Failed Login Attempts If you enter incorrect credentials three times consecutively , your account will be temporarily locked for 1 hour . Please double-check your username and password before running the script to avoid triggering this lockout. Appendix: Parameter Reference of Config.json A. user_credentials: Field Description Required username Your username for MOSDAC login (*) Yes password Your password for MOSDAC login (*) Yes Correct Example: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Incorrect Example : \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" } (Both fields must be filled in correctly for authentication to succeed.) B. search_parameters: Field Description Required Notes datasetId The dataset that you want to download Yes Example: \" 3SIMG_L1B_STD \" startTime he start date from which data should be downloaded. No Format: \"YYYY-MM-DD\" Example: \"2024-09-25\" endTime The end date up to which data should be downloaded.

This tool allows you to download satellite data seamlessly using a simple configuration fileâ€” config.json . Once you have filled out this file correctly according to your download requirements, simply run the script mdapi.py . No need to modify any code! This manual will provide you step-by-step guide to download data though \" MOSDAC Data Download API \". 1. Prerequisites: For running this application, you will need following things: i .   Python (Version 3+) ii. Python Library: 'requests' iii. MOSDAC Account credentials (Refer section 5 for ' Authentication ' ) iv. 'datasetId' (Refer section 5 for ' How to find your DatasetId (datasetId) ?' ) Optional Requirement: i. Python Library: 'tqdm' Steps to Install Python Libraries: Requests: i. Check if you have the 'requests' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show requests If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. ii. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install requests This will successfully install the 'requests' module in your system. You can follow the first step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. Tqdm (Optional): iii. Check if you have the 'tqdm' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show tqdm If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. iv. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install tqdm This will successfully install the 'requests'module in your system. You can follow the previous step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. [ Hint : Although not a requirement, installing the Python library - 'tqdm', will provide an enhanced download experience by providing a well-structured 'Progress Bar' while downloading data, providing a clean and visually appealing download process.] 2. How to Download, Install & Run: i. Download 'mdapi' from: https://mosdac.gov.in/software/mdapi.zip ii. Unzip the folder in your desired directory. One will find the following files: a. mdapi.py b. config.json Following is the structure of config.json: { \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" }, \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"\", \"startTime\": \"\", \"endTime\": \"\", \"count\": \"\", \"boundingBox\": \"\", \"gId\": \"\" }, \"download_settings\": { \"download_path\": \"\", \"organize_by_date\":false, \"skip_user_prompt\":false, \"generate_error_log\":false, \"error_log_path\": \"\" } } [ Important Tip : Make sure you don't change the name of your Configuration File, i.e. - 'config.json'. Doing so will prevent successful execution of your 'mdapi.py' code, as the name of the Configuration file is already pre-configured inside it.] iii. Edit config.json correctly as per your data requirement, along with your user credentials. ( Refer section: ' Parameter Reference of config.json ' ) iv. In your terminal, run: python mdapi.py v. After fetching the search results, you will see the following message: (If skip_user_prompt is set false ) Do you want to start downloading? (Y/N): vi. Type Y (or Yes) and hit Enter to start the download process. vii. After the Download is complete, you will see a logout message, containing: Download Complete! Logout Successful. Goodbye (your_username) ! [ Background Download : For background downloading set 'skip_user_input' as - true in your 'config.json' file. This will start data download without user interaction.] [ Daily Download Limit : We allow users to download a maximum of 5000 data files per day, per user. If your download exceeds that limit, you will see the message: 'You have reached your Daily Download Quota (5000 per day)' and will be automatically logged out. You will have to wait until the next day if you want to download more data.] 3. Data Download Workflow: Data download workflow includes the following steps to download data through MOSDAC: i. Data Search : Based on the input provided by the user in 'search_parameter' of 'client.json', our application will first fetch the total available files count and their total size. For this, one should know the required 'datasetId'. (Refer section 4 for details) ii. Authentication process : Once the search results are retrieved, if the user provides the input to proceed for download, user authentication takes place. (Refer section 5 for details) iii. Data download : After successful authentication, the data download begins as per user defined configuration. iv . Logout : After completion of the entire process, the user is logged out automatically. 4. Searching data: You don't need to log in to search; an account is only required to download data . If your goal is just to search or preview available datasets using filters like datasetId , startTime , or boundingBox , etc., you can leave the 'user_credentials' blank. No authentication is needed in that case. However, DatasetId is required for search. Following section will guide you how to find your DatasetId: How to Find Your Dataset ID ( datasetId )? In the config.json file, under the search_parameters section, there is a required field called datasetId . This field specifies which dataset you want to download from , and it is mandatory for the application to fetch any data. Where to Find Available Dataset IDs You can explore the available dataset IDs here: Browse datasets : https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php On this page, you can: Browse or filter datasets based on: o Satellite o Sensor o Search Find your desired Product Name (Eg: 3SIMG_L1B_STD, E06OCM_L2C_AD ) , which corresponds to the datasetId you should enter in your config file. Example Workflow i. Visit the dataset browser: https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php ii. Use filters to narrow down your options by satellite, sensor, etc. iii. Identify the product you're interested in. iv. Copy the Product Name exactly as shown - this is your datasetId . Example: If the product name is 3SIMG_L1B_STD , then your config should include: \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1B_STD\" Tip: Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces in the datasetId . It must match the platform's listing exactly . 5. Authentication and Account Requirements To download any data using this application, you must first authenticate yourself using valid credentials. Authentication Process The application uses your MOSDAC Account credentials (username and password) to authenticate your session before downloading begins. These credentials must be provided in the config.json file under the user_credentials section: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Important: Without valid credentials, you will not be able to download any data. Don't Have an Account? If you donâ€™t already have an account, you must create one first: Create your account here : https://mosdac.gov.in/signup/ Once your registration is complete and your account is approved , you will be eligible to use the application for downloading datasets. Forgot Your Password? You can reset your password here: Reset your password : https://mosdac.gov.in/auth/realms/Mosdac/login-actions/reset-credentials Failed Login Attempts If you enter incorrect credentials three times consecutively , your account will be temporarily locked for 1 hour . Please double-check your username and password before running the script to avoid triggering this lockout. Appendix: Parameter Reference of Config.json A. user_credentials: Field Description Required username Your username for MOSDAC login (*) Yes password Your password for MOSDAC login (*) Yes Correct Example: \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"your_username\", \"password\": \"your_password\" } Incorrect Example : \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" } (Both fields must be filled in correctly for authentication to succeed.) B. search_parameters: Field Description Required Notes datasetId The dataset that you want to download Yes Example: \" 3SIMG_L1B_STD \" startTime he start date from which data should be downloaded. No Format: \"YYYY-MM-DD\" Example: \"2024-09-25\" endTime The end date up to which data should be downloaded. No Format: \"YYYY-MM-DD\" Example: \"2024-10-25\" count Maximum number of records you want to download. No Max value: 100 boundingBox Area-wise filter your selected â€˜datasetIdâ€™. No Format: \"minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat\" Example: \"70.0,8.0,90.0,28.0\" gId Granule ID (specific ID if only one file is to be downloaded.) No Must be exact. Example: \"15039367\" [ Tip: Although not required, we recommend setting the 'startTime' and 'endTime' according to your requirement, otherwise the search API will fetch results of the entire lifespan of the provided dataset.] Correct Example: \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1B_STD\", \"startTime\": \"2024-10-25\", \"endTime\": \"2025-03-27\", \"count\": \"50\", \"boundingBox\": \"70.0,8.0,90.0,28.0\", \"gId\": \"\" } Incorrect Example : \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"3SIMG_L1\", // Incorrect/Incomplete datasetId value \"startTime\": \"25-10-2024\", //Incorrect Date Format \"endTime\": \"2023-10-25â€™, // endTime > startTime \"count\": \"500\", // Count > Max Count \"boundingBox\": \"70.0, 8.0\", // Incorrect boundingBox Format \"gId\": \"1437ZBL1\" // Incorrect gId value } C. download_settings (Optional) Customize how downloads and logging behave.

This satellite is developed out of a small I-1000 bus made of carbon fibre re-enforced plastic light weight structure, a uni power bus employing an 18AH Ni-Cd battery and a single GaAs/Ge solar panel generating 640 watts of power. Metsat uses a 3-axis stabilized momentum biased attitude control system with suitable linearly controlled magnetic torquers for solar radiation pressure compensation. A unified propulsion system of bi-propellant apogee motor of 440 Newtons and the reaction control engines of 22 Newtons has been selected for efficient and versatile mission management. Metsat carries on-board a Very High ResolutionRadiometer (VHRR) and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) for weather data transmission. VHRR provides earth imageries in visible band with a resolution of2 km, in thermal infrared and water vapor bands with 8 km. DRT collects weather data from un-attended data collection platforms located throughout India and transmits the same to centrally located Meteorological Data Utilisation Centre. The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a lift–off mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries. हिन्दी Missions KALPANA-1 Introduction Objectives SpaceCraft Payloads Data Products ",

The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a lift–off mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries. हिन्दी ",

A central structural thrust cylinder provides mounting interfaces propellant tanks, pressurant tank, equipment panels, payload, solar array assembly, and with the launch vehicle. Structural brackets are provided to mount momentum wheels, reaction wheel, RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters, earth sensors, sun sensors, LAM (Liquid Apogee Motor), and propulsion components. MetSat-1 is three-axis stabilized (momentum biased control subsystem). However, unlike its INSAT predecessors, the MetSat-1 spacecraft does not feature a sail/boom design. The attitude is sensed by suite of sensors (gyros, Earth sensors, digital sun sensor, coarse analog sun sensors, and solar panel sun sensor). Magnetic torquers serve as actuators to unload the momentum of the wheels. In addition, active thrusters are used (one 440N LAM for orbit raising maneuvers and eight 22 N thrusters for orbit and attitude control). The propulsion system employed is a unified bi-propellant with mono-methyl hydrazine (MMH) as fuel and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON3) as oxidizer. The S/C employs passive thermal control system by utilizing multi-layer insulation blankets, optical solar reflectors, heat sinks, paints, thermal grease, thermal shields etc. The temperature of individual subsystems spread over the satellite is maintained by a bank of 112 heaters. EPS (Electrical Power Subsystem): Electrical power of 550 W is generated by a single panel solar array of 2.15 m x 1.85 m using GaAS solar cells.

The VHRR observes in VIS, water vapor and TIR bands providing a spatial resolution of 2 km in VIS band and 8 km for the rest. VHRR was developed by SAC (Satellite Application Center), Ahmedabad, India. The instrument operates in three scanning modes: Full frame mode (20° North-South x 20° East-West), minimum in about 33 minutes covering the entire Earth disk Normal frame mode (14° N-S x 20° E-W), minimum in about 23 minutes Sector frame mode in which the sector can be positioned anywhere in steps of 0.5° in the N-S direction to cover 4.5° N-S x 20° E-W. This mode is particularly suited for rapid, repetitive coverage during severe weather conditions like a cyclone. The nominal frame repetition rates are: 40, 30 and 20 minutes respectively. VHRR is an opto-mechanical system (whiskbroom type imager). The incoming solar radiation is reflected onto a Ritchey-Chretien telescope of 20 cm aperture by a beryllium scan mirror mounted at 45° to the optical axis. The optical system includes a gold-film dichoric beam-splitter that transmits visible light energy and reflects WV/TIR energy, so that the radiation from the Earth is channelized to the visible and IR focal planes simultaneously. The visible band detector configuration consists of two staggered arrays of four silicon photodiodes each; while two sets of mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT) detector elements operating nominally at 100-110 K sense the WV/thermal radiation. The scan mirror is mounted on a two-axis, gimballed scan mechanism system to generate a 2-D image by sweeping the detector instantaneous field of view (FOV) across the Earth's surface in east to west (fast scan) and north to south (slow scan).

It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1°X 0.1° on a latitude/longitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) algorithm (Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022) with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared (IR) technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared (MVK) combined (Mega et al. 2019). A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. (2022).

Also, hydrological modelling studies face the challenge of decreasing availability of in-situ monitoring data. However, application of satellite radar altimetry over the inland water bodies becomes vital tool to estimate water levels through waveform retracking on satellite altimetry?s sensor data. SARAL-Altika was launched on 25 February 2013. It is a joint-mission of CNES France and ISRO to provide continuous monitoring of ocean and continental water surface. It was launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790km with 35 days of orbit repetition and follows same ground track as ENVISAT satellite. It has 98.55 deg of inclination with 75 km of equatorial cross track separation. It has Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter. Water level product for inland water bodies (presently for Brahmaputra river and Ukai Reservoir) has been generated using the SARAL-ALTIKA waveform data.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The algorithm is called Lagrangian Reconstruction Technique. User should refer [1]. Limitations This algorithm is applicable only in the region with moderate to high eddy kinetic energy and where lateral advection dominates. High resolution sea surface salinity product generated by Lagrangian technique can have error due to tracer bias (depends on accuracy of initial conditions) and advection bias (Passive stirring can introduce bias due to mixing physics (air-sea fluxes, mixing etc.)). Known problems with data Data sets have biases as well as inaccuracy.

This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically. 7 Dataset Contact Jai Kumar, POD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380015, kumarj@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update Frequency Six months. 9 Access Rights or Restriction Open Access 10 Spatial Resolution Spatial resolution is 10 km 11 Language English 12 Topic Category High resolution sea surface salinity product (SAC-TDP) using satellite data. 13 Keywords Sea surface salinity, sea surface currents, Lagrangian advection technique, high resolution 14 Date or period April 2015 - June 2023 15 Responsible Party Jai Kumar, POD/AOGG/ EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India 16 Organization Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, India 16a Org. role Geophysical parameters from satellite data in the Bay of Bengal region. 16b Individual name Jai Kumar, POD/AOSG/EPSA, SAC (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India.

High resolution sea surface salinity product generated by Lagrangian technique can have error due to tracer bias (depends on accuracy of initial conditions) and advection bias (Passive stirring can introduce bias due to mixing physics (air-sea fluxes, mixing etc.)). Known problems with data Data sets have biases as well as inaccuracy.

This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically. 7 Dataset Contact Jai Kumar, POD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380015, kumarj@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update Frequency Six months. 9 Access Rights or Restriction Open Access 10 Spatial Resolution Spatial resolution is 10 km 11 Language English 12 Topic Category High resolution sea surface salinity product (SAC-TDP) using satellite data. 13 Keywords Sea surface salinity, sea surface currents, Lagrangian advection technique, high resolution 14 Date or period April 2015 - June 2023 15 Responsible Party Jai Kumar, POD/AOGG/ EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India 16 Organization Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, India 16a Org. role Geophysical parameters from satellite data in the Bay of Bengal region. 16b Individual name Jai Kumar, POD/AOSG/EPSA, SAC (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India.

The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARAL/ALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products .

Processing Steps Using the daily gridded data of MADT, Vector winds and SST data the Geostrophic, wind driven and buoyancy components of the ocean surface current respectively are first calculated for the off-equatorial regions (3°N to 90°N and 3°S to 90°S). Using the polynomial expansion the equatorial currents (±3° latitude band) are derived. The daily ocean surface current at 0.25° resolution is then derived by applying a linear weighted average procedure to the equatorial and off equatorial current solutions with in the latitude band of ± 3° to ± 4° band.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The methodology follows the work of Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U = (u,v) is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate z , and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity A uniform with depth. The vertical shear U z reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z = - H . Using complex notations U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y , the basic equations are if U = - (1/ρ m ) ∇ p + AU z (1a) (1/ρm) p z = -g + ∇θ (1b) ∇θ = g χ T ∇SST , (1c) with - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions U z (z=0) = τ / A (2a) U z (z = -H) = 0 (2b) The characteristic density is ρ m = 1025 kg m -3 , The acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s -2 , and the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10 -4 K -1 , The vector field τ = τ x + i τ y represents the surface wind stress divided by ρ m , H has been chosen to be 70 m, The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1) b | w| 1 m s -1 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 . The equation for the velocity shear is U z - (if/A) U z = (1/A)∇θ (3) which is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions (2a,b). After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is if U 0 = -g ∇ζ + (1/H ) q(H/h e )τ + ((H/2)/q(H/2he))∇θ (4) Here the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and h e = (A/if ) 1/2 is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth h e = sqrt( 2A/|f|). Using equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). Limitations As the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents. Known problems with data As these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.

          "content": "The methodology follows the work of Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U = (u,v) is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate z , and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity A uniform with depth. The vertical shear U z reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z = - H . Using complex notations U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y , the basic equations are if U = - (1/ρ m ) ∇ p + AU z (1a) (1/ρm) p z = -g + ∇θ (1b) ∇θ = g χ T ∇SST , (1c) with - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions U z (z=0) = τ / A (2a) U z (z = -H) = 0 (2b) The characteristic density is ρ m = 1025 kg m -3 , The acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s -2 , and the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10 -4 K -1 , The vector field τ = τ x + i τ y represents the surface wind stress divided by ρ m , H has been chosen to be 70 m, The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1) b | w| 1 m s -1 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 . The equation for the velocity shear is U z - (if/A) U z = (1/A)∇θ (3) which is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions (2a,b). After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is if U 0 = -g ∇ζ + (1/H ) q(H/h e )τ + ((H/2)/q(H/2he))∇θ (4) Here the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and h e = (A/if ) 1/2 is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth h e = sqrt( 2A/|f|). Using equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002).

It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product. 7 Dataset Contact Aditya Chaudhary, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015, aditya.osd@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update frequency 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa have been processed.

It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product. 7 Dataset Contact Aditya Chaudhary, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015, aditya.osd@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update frequency 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa have been processed.

          "content": " The Sea Ice Occurrence Probability (SIOP36) data were prepared from 36 years (October 1978 to December 2014) NSIDC sea ice concentration (SIC) data over the Antarctic Region (Cavalieri, 1996). The SIC data were downloaded from NSIDC data site:( http://nsidc.org/data (link is external)). The SIOP36 data consist of 366 data files corresponding to 366 days with the first file representing 1st January and the last, 31st December. The file naming nomenclature follows SIOP36_MMDD_S.bin[.tif/.png] format; where MM refers to month number (01 to 12, 01 being January), DD refers to date of the month, and the character S refers to Southern Hemishphere. Data formats are indicated by .bin (Binary), .tif (GeoTIFF), and .png (Portable Network Graphics). Data is freely available to global scientific community and can be downloaded from www.mosdac.gov.in (link is external). Probability values are calculated from the long-term NASA Team algorithm-derived SMMR-SSM/I-SSMIS sea ice concentration product (Cavalieri, 1996). The dataset is given in Polar Stereographic projection with a grid size of 25km x 25km in latitude and longitude. The grid coordinates of the upper left pixel are 39.2 deg S, 42.2 deg W. There are 316 columns and 332 rows. Data values are stored as IEEE floats representing probabilities in the range 0-100%. Pixels with zero values corresponds to either Antarctic land/ice or ocean water. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products . Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data. Data Version SIOP36 (ver BETA) Data Sources The major input data is NASA Team algorithm-derived SMMR-SSM/I-SSMIS sea ice concentration data over Antarctic Region (Cavalieri, 1996) for 36 years (October 1978 to December 2014). The data was downloaded from NSIDC data site: ( http://nsidc.org/data ). Processing Steps Following are the three major processing steps : i. Classification of pixels into sea-ice and non-sea-ice classes. ii. Determination of sea-ice-pixel frequency over study period iii. Calculation of Sea Ice Probability iv. Converting the data into three (.bin, .tif, and .png) formats. Data Citation Data Citation This dataset may be cited as (Rajak et al, 2015). Rajak D. Ram, R.K.

Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies.

Launched in 2018, the \nportal has since undergone continuous enhance-\nments, making it a robust tool for forecasting rip \ncurrents at nearly 175 beaches across the country. \nThe user-friendly interface allows visitors to se-\nlect their desired state and beach to view rip cur-\nrent risk levels. For mobile users, the portal con-\nveniently utilizes built-in GPS to automatically \ndetect the user's location and display the nearest \nbeach forecast. \nRip currents are influenced by a combination of \nwaves, tides, and local bathymetry (the underwa-\nter topography of the seabed). While bathymetry \ncan be difficult to predict, waves and tides are \nmore reliable indicators. The Safe Beach portal \nleverages this predictability, focusing on the com-\nbined effects of waves and tides in forming rip \ncurrents.  The Safe Beach portal provides a three-\nday forecast for rip current risk, automatically \nupdated every day between 4-5 PM IST , based on \nthe previous day’s satellite data. \nArchitecture of Safe \nBeach assimilated with \nsatellite data \nRip Current Forecast \nat Fort Kochi Beach, \nKerala \n \nAvailable at  \nhttps://mosdac.gov.in/\nrip/ \n9 \nOctober 2025 \nhttps://mosdac.gov.in \nWhere People Live \nAI In Action: \nS \npace-borne sensors offer a valuable means \nof acquiring a long-term record of rapidly \nexpanding urban centres. Urban sprawl \nstudies play a crucial role in assessing the \nfuture land requirements for cities and simulating \nurban expansion under varying policies and invest-\nment decisions. Built-up area, a key parameter in \nsuch assessments, serves as an indicator of eco-\nnomic growth and anthropogenic activity while \nmarking a significant factor endangering the natu-\nral environment. \nIndian Remote Sensing Satellites have been ac-\nquiring remote sensing data at a spatial resolution \nof 5.8 m, suitable for mapping sprawl in cities, \nsince the launch of the IRS 1C satellite in 1997. \nThe Urban Sprawl Information System (USIS) appli-\ncation on VEDAS provides information on the ex-\ntent of built-up areas of 500 Indian cities for 2023\n-2024 timeframe.

The sea state information is of utmost im-\nportance for safe navigation. The sea state condi-\ntions include the physical state of the sea in \nterms of its wave height, wave period, surface \ncurrents, and surface wind conditions in the pre-\nsent and future (up to 5 days). The present sea \nstate conditions are obtained in near real-time \nfrom satellite observations of scatterometers, al-\ntimeters, and other remote sensing sensors. These \ninitial conditions are assimilated into the numeri-\ncal models of the ocean (wave and circulation) \nand atmosphere to generate a forecast of the \nconditions up to 5 days in advance. For providing \nthe optimal routes for the ships, Dijkstra’s algo-\nrithm, which is based on a weighted graph of con-\nnected nodes, has been used. \nThe weather and ocean state forecast for wind \nspeed, sea level pressure, sea surface currents, \nand significant wave height is generated regularly \nusing satellite data assimilative weather and \nocean models and are hosted in near real-time on \nthe \"Ocean Eye\" web application hosted on the \nMOSDAC web portal.

This system is now operational on VEDAS  \nportal and will be transferred to MoA&FW. \nTowards that, SAC has developed the automated \ngeo-processor for yield estimation and generated \nthe algorithm for implementing the Semi-physical \nmodel in this system for generating yield esti-\nmates of rice, soybean (kharif), wheat and mus-\ntard (rabi) crops. The remote sensing based semi-\nphysical model developed at SAC is based on the \nphysiological process of plant–light absorption for \nphotosynthesis and the radiation use efficiency, \nwhich is a measure of plant’s efficiency to con-\nvert intercepted radiation and CO2 into dry mat-\nter based on the genetic makeup as well as the \nenvironmental stress factors that prevailed in ac-\ntual field conditions. Its strength lies in adopting \na process-based framework with limited parame-\nterization. \nThe dashboard displays both inputs and outputs. \nThe input parameters of the model include PAR, \nFAPAR, and Water & temperature scalar at differ-\nent temporal intervals. The outputs from the sys-\ntem include the area, biomass, yield and produc-\ntion at district and state level.  District and state \nlevel rice yield (Kharif) estimates of 13 major \nstates and soybean yield of MP for the year 2024-\n25 as well as for mustard and wheat yields for \n2024-25 in rabi season has been generated \nthrough this automated system and has been \nshared to MoA&FW and MNCFC.

They include measures like absorption coefficients (how different \nsubstances such as phytoplankton, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and detritus absorb light \nat various wavelengths) and backscattering coefficients (how particles scatter light). These properties \nare important because they determine the colour of the water as seen by a satellite sensor. \nChlorophyll-a Concentration  \nChlorophyll-a is the primary pigment in phyto-\nplankton, and its concentration indicates the \namount of these microscopic algae in the water. \nIt is a key indicator of ocean productivity where \nthe high chlorophyll levels often mean nutrient-\nrich areas crowded with life (useful for identifying \npotential fishing zones). Phytoplankton form the \nbase of the marine food web and play a vital role \nin global cycles by producing oxygen and absorb-\ning carbon dioxide.  \n8-day composite (Feb 8-15, 2025) of Chlorophyll-a \nconcentration derived from OCM-3 \nPhytoplankton abs. (aph) and particle backscattering (bb) derived from OCM-3 (Feb 11, 2025) \nPhotosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR)  \nPhotosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR) is \nthe portion of sunlight (approximately 400–700 nm \nin wavelength) that can be used by plants and \nphytoplankton for photosynthesis. Essentially, it \nrepresents the solar energy available in the upper \nlayers of the ocean to drive the growth of \nphytoplankton. In ocean applications, knowledge \nof PAR is important for modelling how much \ncarbon is being fixed in the oceans (oceanic \nprimary \nproduction) \nand \nfor \nunderstanding \necosystem dynamics.  \n2-day composite of PAR derived from OCM-3  \n(April 1 & 2, 2024) \nOCM-3 Products on MOSDAC \nData Products: \n14 \nMOSDAC & VEDAS NEWSLETTER | Vol. 1, No. 1 \nhttps://vedas.sac.gov.in \nPhytoplankton Size Classes (PSC)  \nPhytoplankton Size Classes refer to categorizing phytoplankton by their cell size (for example, micro-\nplankton, nano-plankton, and pico-plankton). This classification is important because the size of phyto-\nplankton influences marine food webs and biogeochemical processes as different sizes are consumed by \ndifferent grazers and have varying roles in carbon export. Satellite ocean-color data (like OCM-3’s \nmeasurements) can be used not only to estimate total phytoplankton abundance but also to infer the \nprevailing size classes. This is possible because phytoplankton of different sizes have distinct optical \nsignatures in how they absorb and scatter light. This translate into subtle changes in the color of the \nocean observed by the sensor.  \n8-day composite (Mar 5-\n12, 2024) of micro-\nphytoplankton (in %) \nderived from OCM-3 \nThe 250 TF Sagar High-Performance Computing \n(HPC), comprising 70 nodes, was established in \nthe EPSA, SAC for a range of Earth science appli-\ncations. It was inaugurated by Dr V. Narayanan, \nSecretary DOS and Chairman ISRO, on February \n17, 2025. This high-performance computing envi-\nronment plays a pivotal role in supporting various \natmospheric and oceanic modelling activities. It is \nalso essential for conducting Observation System \nSimulation Experiments (OSSEs) aimed at defining \nfuture spaceborne sensors. \nResearch using the current HPC system has al-\nready led to significant advancements, including \nthe sensor definition of future hyperspectral Mi-\ncrowave and Infrared Sounders, as well as an ad-\nLeveraging the 250 TF Sagar HPC for Advanced Earth Science Research \nvanced \nImager. \nAdditionally, \nhigh-resolution \nocean modelling and data assimilation research \nhave been successfully carried out. The HPC has \nalso enabled magnetohydrodynamic simulations \nfor astrophysical flows and supported various \nspace science models. \nMoreover, the system is being used for hydrologi-\ncal modeling in flood prediction and air quality \nstudies. This existing hardware is a cornerstone \nfor these critical applications, but it will need to \nbe upgraded to accommodate future research de-\nmands, particularly for high-spectral, spatial, and \ntemporal resolution observations from upcoming \nIndian satellites. \n15 \nOctober 2025 \nhttps://mosdac.gov.in \nExtreme Weather Events: Space Based Monitoring \nand Climate Impact over Mauritius Island  \nNew Application on MOSDAC: \nM \nauritius is severely affected by extreme \nweather events, leading to human and \neconomic losses.

It fuses satellite ob-\nservations (INSAT-3D/3DS, EOS-06 OCM-3, Sentinel\n-5P TROPOMI, Cartosat-3, Resourcesat-2/2A LISS-\n4, Sentinel-2) with process models and field in-\nstrumentation to track the region’s most critical \nsystems in near-real time. Flagship layers include \ncryosphere and hydrology (snow/glacier melt, \nSPHY-based discharge with NEWLG water-level \nsensors on the Indus), urban analytics for Leh (AI-\nextracted built-up growth 2016–2025, 3D city \nmodel and rooftop solar potential), air-quality \nintelligence (satellite trace gases & AOD with in-\nsitu ozone/PM2.5 at University of Ladakh), and \nhybrid weather (WRF + AI/ML) with satellite-\ndriven heavy-rain nowcasts. Outputs are interac-\ntive maps, time-series probes, and grid summaries \ntailored for administrators, community and re-\nsearchers in a data-sparse environment.  \nBeyond operations, LAMA advances frontier stud-\nies vital to Ladakh’s resilience and growth: miner-\nal diversity mapping from EMIT hyperspectral data \n(with \nlandslide-relevant \nmica/serpentine \nin-\nsights), land-degradation status and wind-erosion \nimpacts on rangelands, agriculture monitoring \n(LAI/chlorophyll inversions, NDVI seasonality, dai-\nly PET for irrigation advisories), and THz astrono-\nmy site characterisation at Hanle (atmospheric \ntransmittance modelling). A dedicated calibra-\ntion/validation program (corner reflectors for EOS\n-04/Sentinel-1, AWS and micromet stations at \nKhardung La, glacier sites) underpins product ac-\ncuracy. Co-developed with the Ladakh Administra-\ntion and University of Ladakh, LAMA is positioned \nas a living laboratory that turns space-to-ground \nscience into actionable, locally tuned governance.  \nLAMA Landing Page \nAvailable at \nhttps://vedas.sac.gov.in/\nvapps/lama/ \n3D Visualization and \nSolar Energy \nEstimation \n19 \nOctober 2025 \nhttps://mosdac.gov.in \nBODHI: Bihar Oriented Spatial Dataset & Hazard \nInformation \nRegion-specific Application on VEDAS: \nB \nODHI (Bihar Oriented Spatial Dataset & \nHazard Information) is a state-focused geo-\nspatial platform from SAC–ISRO that turns \nsatellite observations and model outputs \ninto actionable decision support for Bihar.
